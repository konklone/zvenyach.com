One of the more inside-baseball parts of government contracting is conducting market research to predict your competitors' cost. If you've been in the game for a while, you generally know what others are charging and where you stack up. But, what if you're new and trying to assess your position? Or, what if you're just interested in finding out how much stuff should cost?

First, the bad news. You actually can't get the *real* prices paid. There are reasons that I won't get into here, but the bottom line is that companies use a couple of different techniques to obfuscate the actual cost of services provided.

Now, the good news. In most cases,[^1] you *can* tell what a company claims their *highest* government rate is if they're on a GSA Schedule. Under the [Price Reduction Clause](https://www.contractorsperspective.com/compliance/applying-the-price-reduction-clause-in-gsa-schedule-contracts/) for GSA Schedule contracts, a contractor generally[^2] agrees to give the best rate to the government, and the contractor has to adjust its price offerings if the contractor "grants more favorable discounts or terms and conditions" to a commercial customer. Given this point of information, you can generally know the *top end* of what a government contractor will charge for an hourly rate.

So how do you find that information? I look in three places: GSA's [eLibrary](https://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/), GSA [Advantage](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/), and GSA's [CALC](https://calc.gsa.gov). Why are there three places, you might be wondering? That's for another day, but you'll need to buy me a bourbon neat. For now, let's look at how to find the rates in those places.

In eLibrary, the best trick is to see if you know your competition. If you're looking for a particular company, there's a [Contractor Directory](https://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/contractorList.do?contractorListFor=A) (as of November 2018, it's underneath the search bar and a little to the left).

Suppose you're looking up the contract for `'APPS' CONSULTANTS INC., THE`.[^3] It's super hard to find, but if you look for the little document image in the `Contractor T&Cs/Pricelist` column (screenshot below), it'll actually pop up a Word document or PDF. In that document, somewhere, there will be a table with labor rates. In our example, a Project Manager from `'Apps' Consultants Inc., The` has an hourly labor rate of $110 in the first year of the contract. It goes up to $126.72 in the last year of the contract.

If you're not sure who your competition is, you can use the word search functionality of GSA Advantage. I usually just go straight to the ["Advanced Search"](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/advncdSearchSrvsEnter.do) functionality because it has filtering and exact phrase searches that I use a lot. But, otherwise it's the same deal as with eLibrary: search for the term (or the company name) and then download the catalog/pricelist. On the pricelist, look for the table with the rates. Boom.

Finally, there's CALC. Compared to GSA eLibrary and GSA Advantage, CALC is a user-interface godsend. Type in the type of labor rate you're looking for and it'll give you a range of prices, and even a standard deviation in either direction. But CALC is *only* useful for labor rates, so you can't look up products or services (such as training services). And although the interface is amazing, the data hasn't always been as reliably complete as I'd like it to be and it doesn't have some of the filtering capabilities (socioeconomic filters in particular) that can be useful in market research. So I use CALC in conjunction with GSA eLibrary and GSA Advantage. But it's not quite a substitute, yet.

In sum, even though each is limited in its own way, these three sites have a treasure trove of data that you can use to find about your competition's price, if you know what you're looking for. Fortunately, with just a little practice, you can become pretty adept at using these sites. And that superpower may even help you and your organization have an edge on the competition.

[^1]: I say *most cases* because there's a nuanced exception associated with the [Transaction Data Reporting ("TDR") pilot program](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/23/2016-14728/general-services-administration-acquisition-regulation-gsar-transactional-data-reporting) that I won't get into here but may one day fundamentally alter how industry and the government reports transaction-level data. For now, though, TDR isn't going to be all that useful in answering the main question, so I simply note it and move on.

[^2]: I say *generally* because there are a few exceptions that, like the exception in the previous footnote, is not helpful for the current analysis but I want to avoid blanket assertions.

[^3]: Amazingly, it's the first result on the list. Special kudos to the person who realized that a single quotation and setting off the definite article in its name as a first name would get you on the list. This is, no joke, an impressive bit of bureaucracy hacking.
